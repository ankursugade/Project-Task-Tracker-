## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant teal (#008080) to represent forward movement and clarity.
- Background color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF), subtly desaturated for a clean, unobtrusive background that allows project details to stand out.
- Accent color: A soft, muted blue (#ADD8E6) to draw attention to CTAs.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, offering a balance of modern tech feel and readability. 
- Use simple, clear icons to represent project stages and task statuses. Consistent and intuitive iconography to enhance user experience.
- Employ a clean and structured layout with clear divisions between sections to maintain an organized flow.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance user engagement, such as highlighting a task upon status change.
